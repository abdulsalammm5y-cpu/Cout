/*
 * The landing page, on odoo.com's design: the flat white header, the two-column
 * hero (promise on the left, the clustered-to-cleared split you drag on the
 * right), the "imagine without" source wall straight underneath it, five
 * classes of work with a photograph each, the clearance run on its track line,
 * the done-for-you package with its six-phase timeline and sample settlement,
 * then what the desk does, the four-class collage, the arched
 * "done right" band carrying the plan, social proof, the service request form,
 * the closing call to action, the FAQ underneath it, and the aubergine
 * footer.
 *
 * It is pitched for the Stuffout clearance desk: sources swept on
 * cadence, four scoring engines and a master router, one decision per lead —
 * bid, wholesale, cleanout, runner-scrap or pass — and revenue-share
 * monetization that never needs upfront cash.
 *
 * The skin lives in `.theme-odoo` (src/index.css) so none of it reaches the
 * signed-in workspace, and every section it composes is in
 * src/components/templates/odoo/.

const FAQ: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Which assets does it cover?",
    a: "Five classes: storage units heading to lien sale, distressed real estate, estates and probate property, commercial closures, and bulk junk or scrap. Every lead is tagged, scored and routed by its own class engine.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do the scoring engines work?",
    a: "Each class has its own weighted rubric: brand visibility, container composition, owner motivation, title clarity and so on. The math is fixed. The same inputs always produce the same score. The router then turns that score into bid, conditional bid, contract, cleanout, scrap run or pass.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does it cost to run a deal?",
    a: "Nothing upfront. Every deal is structured as a revenue share, a wholesaling assignment fee or pay-after-sale. The same-day scrap floor pays the runners and crews first so the operation never needs capital.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do owners and heirs actually get?",
    a: "A written agreement and a plain-English deal: storage tenants keep a share of resale instead of getting nothing at auction, estates are cleared for free with 80 to 90% of net proceeds remitted, and homeowners get a cash offer through mapped investors with zero commissions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle everything encountered?",
    a: "No. Hard vetoes out regardless of the score: biohazards, unresolvable title defects, jurisdictions requiring licensure we don't hold. Those leads get logged, code-recorded and passed to a partner.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do the runners and crews get paid?",
    a: "On the day the job pays. Scrap yards settle same-day, runners take 30 to 40% of what each run nets, and nobody is ever paid upfront. Every payout's math is published in the deal ledger.",
  },
